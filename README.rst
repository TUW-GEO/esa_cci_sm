Contribute
==========

We are happy if you want to contribute. Please raise an issue explaining what
is missing or if you find a bug. We will also gladly accept pull requests
against our master branch for new features or bug fixes.

Development setup
-----------------

For Development we also recommend a ``conda`` environment. You can create one
including test dependencies and debugger by running
``conda env create -f environment.yml``. This will create a new ``esa_cci_sm``
environment which you can activate by using ``source activate esa_cci_sm``.

Guidelines
----------

If you want to contribute please follow these steps:

- Fork the esa_cci_sm repository to your account
- Clone the repository, make sure you use ``git clone --recursive`` to also get
  the test data repository.
- make a new feature branch from the esa_cci_sm master branch
- Add your feature
- Please include tests for your contributions in one of the test directories.
  We use py.test so a simple function called test_my_feature is enough
- submit a pull request to our master branch
